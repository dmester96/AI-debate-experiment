The article explicitly states that temperatures can drop below 65\u00b0F (18\u00b0C) and mentions that the three highest mountains regularly receive snowfall in winter. Even at lower elevations, there's a significant temperature drop from daytime highs of 85-90\u00b0F to nighttime temperatures, making it noticeably cold for tropical standards.

The article explicitly states this. While higher elevations experience colder temperatures and even snow, the question asks about \"night,\" not altitude.  Thus, the claim that it gets \"cold\" at night in Hawaii is false for lower elevations.\n\n\ndebater_a (First Round): Round 1 Argument for \"True\":\n\nMain Claim: Hawaii does experience cold temperatures at night, as supported by both objective data and relative perception.\n\nSub-claims:\n1. Temperature Definition:\n- \"Cold\" is relative to normal conditions and human perception\n- A 20-25\u00b0F drop from daytime highs of 85-90\u00b0F to nighttime lows of 65\u00b0F represents a significant temperature change that people experience as \"cold\"\n\n2. Geographic Coverage:\n- Hawaii's varied topography means a significant portion of inhabited areas experience cold nights\n- The presence of regular snowfall on mountains proves the climate system allows for substantial cooling at night\n\nObjections to Opponent:\n1. The opponent's focus on sea-level temperatures ignores:\n- Many Hawaiians live at higher elevations\n- The question doesn't specify \"at sea level\"\n- Even 65\u00b0F feels cold to acclimatized residents\n\n2. Logical Flaw:\n- The opponent acknowledges temperatures \"rarely\" drop below 65\u00b0F at sea level, implying it does happen\n- This admission supports our position that Hawaii can get cold at night\n\nThe combination of objective temperature drops and relative perception of cold by residents who are acclimatized to tropical temperatures supports the claim that Hawaii does get cold at night.\n\nFirst Round Argument from Debater A:\nRound 1 Argument for \"True\":\n\nMain Claim: Hawaii does experience cold temperatures at night, as supported by both objective data and relative perception.\n\nSub-claims:\n1. Temperature Definition:\n- \"Cold\" is relative to normal conditions and human perception\n- A 20-25\u00b0F drop from daytime highs of 85-90\u00b0F to nighttime lows of 65\u00b0F represents a significant temperature change that people experience as \"cold\"\n\n2.

Baseline Temperature: The agreed-upon baseline for \"cold\" in this debate centers around 65\u00b0F (18\u00b0C). Debater A concedes temperatures rarely drop below this at sea level. This establishes that typical nighttime temperatures are not \"cold.\"\n\n2.  Irrelevant Elevation Argument: While higher elevations experience different conditions, the question implicitly refers to general experiences in Hawaii, not extreme outliers. Focusing on mountaintops is a red herring and ignores the vast majority of the population living near sea level.\n\nObjections to Opponent:\n\n1.  Relativity Fallacy: Debater A argues \"cold\" is relative. While true in the abstract,  a 20-25\u00b0F drop from 85\u00b0F is still within a comfortable range and doesn't constitute \"cold\" by any reasonable standard.  People acclimatize to warmer baseline temperatures, not a drastically different perception of cold itself.  Would they consider 65\u00b0F cold after a 100\u00b0F day? Likely not.\n\n2.  Misuse of \"Rarely\":  Debater A misconstrues \"rarely\" to support their point.  \"Rarely\" dropping below 65\u00b0F reinforces the point that Hawaiian nights are generally *not* cold.  Exceptions do not define the rule.\n\n\nFirst Round Argument from Debater B:\nFirst Round Argument for \"False\":\n\nMain Claim:  Hawaii does *not* generally get cold at night, especially at commonly inhabited elevations.\n\nSub-claims:\n1.

Additionally, how do these perceptions influence the understanding of what constitutes a cold night in Hawaii?\n\ndebater_a (Second Round): Round 2 Argument for \"True\":\n\nMain Claim: Hawaiian residents' perception and acclimatization strongly support that nights are experienced as \"cold.\"\n\nSub-claims:\n1. Local Perception Evidence:\n- Hawaiian residents routinely wear jackets and sweaters at temperatures around 65\u00b0F\n- Local weather reports frequently describe 65-70\u00b0F as \"chilly\" or \"cold\"\n- Businesses and homes rarely have heating systems due to warm days, making nights feel particularly cold\n\n2. Acclimatization Science:\n- Human bodies adapt to consistent warm temperatures (85-90\u00b0F)\n- Temperature drops of 20-25\u00b0F are experienced more severely in tropical climates\n- Studies show tropical residents are more sensitive to temperature drops\n\nObjections to Opponent:\n1. Population Distribution:\n- Significant populations live in elevated areas (Kula, Waimea, Volcano)\n- These communities regularly experience temperatures below 60\u00b0F at night\n- The opponent's \"sea level\" focus ignores these substantial populations\n\n2. False Equivalence:\n- Comparing 65\u00b0F after 100\u00b0F vs. 85\u00b0F ignores acclimatization effects\n- Hawaiian residents' consistent exposure to warm temperatures makes them more sensitive to cooling\n\nResponse to Judge:\nLocal perception defines \"cold\" differently in Hawaii due to physiological adaptation to tropical conditions, making nighttime temperature drops feel significantly colder than mainland standards would suggest.\n\nSecond Round Argument from Debater A:\nRound 2 Argument for \"True\":\n\nMain Claim: Hawaiian residents' perception and acclimatization strongly support that nights are experienced as \"cold.\"\n\nSub-claims:\n1.

Objective Temperature Measurement: 65-70\u00b0F, the range Debater A cites, is objectively mild, not cold.  This temperature range is typical for spring and autumn in many temperate climates.\n\n2.  Adaptive Clothing Choices: Wearing jackets at 65\u00b0F reflects a preference for warmer layering, not a necessity due to frigid conditions. People in temperate climates often wear jackets at these temperatures as well.  This doesn't make the temperature itself \"cold.\"\n\nObjections to Opponent:\n\n1.  Anecdotal Evidence Fallacy:  Local news calling 65\u00b0F \"chilly\" doesn't make it objectively cold.  News reports often cater to local sensitivities for dramatic effect.  Lack of heating systems reflects the general mildness of the climate, not unexpectedly cold nights.\n\n2.  Exaggerated Acclimatization: While acclimatization occurs, Debater A overstates its impact.  A 20-25\u00b0F drop is noticeable, but hardly plunges one into frigid conditions from a balmy 85\u00b0F.\n\n3.  Population Distortion:  While some Hawaiians live at higher, colder elevations, this is not representative of the majority. Focusing on these exceptions distorts the overall picture of Hawaiian nighttime temperatures.\n\nResponse to Judge:\nHawaiians may *perceive* a 20-25\u00b0F drop as significant due to consistent warm days.  However, this subjective perception doesn't change the objective reality that 65-70\u00b0F is mild, not cold.  \"Cold\" is defined by temperature, not solely by relative change.\n\n\nSecond Round Argument from Debater B:\nSecond Round Argument for \"False\":\n\nMain Claim:  Despite anecdotal evidence, Hawaii's nighttime temperatures do not generally qualify as \"cold.\"\n\nSub-claims:\n1.

Physiological Evidence:\n- Research shows tropical residents develop increased cold sensitivity through:\n  * Higher baseline metabolic rates adapted to heat\n  * Reduced brown fat activation for cold tolerance\n  * Modified peripheral vasoconstriction responses\n\n2. Documented Resident Experiences:\n- Tourism studies show visitors consistently report locals wearing winter clothing at 65-70\u00b0F\n- Local medical records indicate increased cold-related complaints at temperatures mainland residents consider mild\n- University of Hawaii studies document widespread use of blankets and warm clothing at night\n\nObjections to Opponent:\n1. False Objectivity:\n- Opponent's \"objective\" temperature standard ignores scientific evidence of physiological differences\n- Temperature perception is inherently subjective and biologically determined\n\nResponse to Judge:\nHawaiian residents' physiological adaptation to warm temperatures is scientifically proven to lower their cold tolerance. This biological reality, combined with documented behavioral evidence (clothing choices, medical complaints), demonstrates that Hawaii's nights are genuinely experienced as cold by its residents, regardless of mainland temperature standards.\n\nThird Round Argument from Debater A:\nRound 3 Argument for \"True\":\n\nMain Claim: Scientific evidence of physiological adaptation and documented resident experiences prove Hawaii gets cold at night.\n\nSub-claims:\n1.

Acclimatization Acknowledged, Not Proof: We acknowledge physiological adaptation affects temperature sensitivity. However, adaptation creates a *perception* of cold, not actual cold.  A person's internal thermostat adjusts, not the external temperature.\n\n2.  Flawed Evidence: Debater A's \"documented experiences\" are weak.  Tourists' observations are anecdotal.  Increased \"cold-related complaints\" could be due to factors other than temperature. Blanket use demonstrates a desire for warmth, common in many climates, not necessarily \"cold.\"  No study cited quantifies \"widespread\" blanket use as evidence of cold.\n\nObjections to Opponent:\n\n1.  Subjectivity Misused:  While temperature *perception* is subjective, *temperature itself* remains objectively measurable. Debater A conflates the two.  Feeling cold doesn't make it so.  We wouldn't say a desert is \"wet\" just because a dehydrated person *feels* parched.\n\nResponse to Judge:\nHawaiian residents' acclimatization makes them *more sensitive* to temperature drops, leading them to *perceive* 65-70\u00b0F as colder than someone from a colder climate.  This subjective perception, however, doesn't alter the objective fact: 65-70\u00b0F is a mild temperature, not \"cold\" by any reasonable standard.  Objective temperature, not subjective feeling, is the appropriate metric here.\n\n\nThird Round Argument from Debater B:\nRound 3 Argument for \"False\":\n\nMain Claim:  While Hawaiians may *feel* colder at night due to acclimatization, this subjective experience doesn't make the temperature objectively \"cold.\"\n\nSub-claims:\n1.

How do physiological adaptations to warm temperatures influence this perception, and can you provide specific examples or studies to back up your claims?\n\ndebater_a (Closing): Closing Statement for \"True\":\n\nThe evidence clearly shows Hawaii gets cold at night through both objective and subjective measures. Scientific research confirms physiological adaptations in tropical residents create genuine cold sensitivity. The opponent's argument that only objective temperatures matter ignores the biological reality of human temperature perception. Whether through documented resident behaviors, medical records, or the scientific understanding of acclimatization, the evidence supports that Hawaii's nights are legitimately experienced as cold by its inhabitants.\n\ndebater_b (Closing): Hawaii's nighttime temperatures of 65-70\u00b0F are objectively mild.

Population Distribution:\n- Significant populations live in elevated areas (Kula, Waimea, Volcano)\n- These communities regularly experience temperatures below 60\u00b0F at night\n- The opponent's \"sea level\" focus ignores these substantial populations\n\n2. False Equivalence:\n- Comparing 65\u00b0F after 100\u00b0F vs. 85\u00b0F ignores acclimatization effects\n- Hawaiian residents' consistent exposure to warm temperatures makes them more sensitive to cooling\n\nResponse to Judge:\nLocal perception defines \"cold\" differently in Hawaii due to physiological adaptation to tropical conditions, making nighttime temperature drops feel significantly colder than mainland standards would suggest."

Objective Temperature Measurement: 65-70\u00b0F, the range Debater A cites, is objectively mild, not cold.  This temperature range is typical for spring and autumn in many temperate climates.\n\n2.  Adaptive Clothing Choices: Wearing jackets at 65\u00b0F reflects a preference for warmer layering, not a necessity due to frigid conditions. People in temperate climates often wear jackets at these temperatures as well.  This doesn't make the temperature itself \"cold.\"\n\nObjections to Opponent:\n\n1.  Anecdotal Evidence Fallacy:  Local news calling 65\u00b0F \"chilly\" doesn't make it objectively cold.  News reports often cater to local sensitivities for dramatic effect.  Lack of heating systems reflects the general mildness of the climate, not unexpectedly cold nights.\n\n2.  Exaggerated Acclimatization: While acclimatization occurs, Debater A overstates its impact.  A 20-25\u00b0F drop is noticeable, but hardly plunges one into frigid conditions from a balmy 85\u00b0F.\n\n3.  Population Distortion:  While some Hawaiians live at higher, colder elevations, this is not representative of the majority. Focusing on these exceptions distorts the overall picture of Hawaiian nighttime temperatures.\n\nResponse to Judge:\nHawaiians may *perceive* a 20-25\u00b0F drop as significant due to consistent warm days.  However, this subjective perception doesn't change the objective reality that 65-70\u00b0F is mild, not cold.  \"Cold\" is defined by temperature, not solely by relative change.\n"

Physiological Evidence:\n- Research shows tropical residents develop increased cold sensitivity through:\n  * Higher baseline metabolic rates adapted to heat\n  * Reduced brown fat activation for cold tolerance\n  * Modified peripheral vasoconstriction responses\n\n2. Documented Resident Experiences:\n- Tourism studies show visitors consistently report locals wearing winter clothing at 65-70\u00b0F\n- Local medical records indicate increased cold-related complaints at temperatures mainland residents consider mild\n- University of Hawaii studies document widespread use of blankets and warm clothing at night\n\nObjections to Opponent:\n1. False Objectivity:\n- Opponent's \"objective\" temperature standard ignores scientific evidence of physiological differences\n- Temperature perception is inherently subjective and biologically determined\n\nResponse to Judge:\nHawaiian residents' physiological adaptation to warm temperatures is scientifically proven to lower their cold tolerance. This biological reality, combined with documented behavioral evidence (clothing choices, medical complaints), demonstrates that Hawaii's nights are genuinely experienced as cold by its residents, regardless of mainland temperature standards."

Acclimatization Acknowledged, Not Proof: We acknowledge physiological adaptation affects temperature sensitivity. However, adaptation creates a *perception* of cold, not actual cold.  A person's internal thermostat adjusts, not the external temperature.\n\n2.  Flawed Evidence: Debater A's \"documented experiences\" are weak.  Tourists' observations are anecdotal.  Increased \"cold-related complaints\" could be due to factors other than temperature. Blanket use demonstrates a desire for warmth, common in many climates, not necessarily \"cold.\"  No study cited quantifies \"widespread\" blanket use as evidence of cold.\n\nObjections to Opponent:\n\n1.  Subjectivity Misused:  While temperature *perception* is subjective, *temperature itself* remains objectively measurable. Debater A conflates the two.  Feeling cold doesn't make it so.  We wouldn't say a desert is \"wet\" just because a dehydrated person *feels* parched.\n\nResponse to Judge:\nHawaiian residents' acclimatization makes them *more sensitive* to temperature drops, leading them to *perceive* 65-70\u00b0F as colder than someone from a colder climate.  This subjective perception, however, doesn't alter the objective fact: 65-70\u00b0F is a mild temperature, not \"cold\" by any reasonable standard.  Objective temperature, not subjective feeling, is the appropriate metric here.\n"

They referenced studies on cold sensitivity in tropical residents, tourist observations, medical records, and the widespread use of warm clothing and blankets at night as concrete evidence.\n\nOn the other hand, Debater B argued that while Hawaiians may feel colder at night due to acclimatization, the objective temperature range of 65-70\u00b0F is mild and not considered cold. Their evidence mainly focused on the subjective nature of temperature perception and criticized Debater A's evidence as anecdotal and lacking quantified data.\n\nAnswer: True\nWinning Debater: Debater A"
