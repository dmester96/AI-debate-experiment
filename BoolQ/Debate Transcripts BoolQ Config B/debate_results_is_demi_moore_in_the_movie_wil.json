Here's my opening statement:\n\nThe film \"Wild Oats\" (2016) definitively features Demi Moore as one of its main stars. The article explicitly lists her among the principal cast members, alongside other notable actors like Jessica Lange and Shirley MacLaine, in this Andy Tennant-directed comedy released by The Weinstein Company.\n\ndebater_b (Opening): Demi Moore stars in *Wild Oats*, but the question's phrasing is crucial.  The provided text states the film *stars* Demi Moore among others.  It does *not* say she is the *only* star. Therefore, the statement \"Demi Moore is *in* the movie Wild Oats\" is true, but the statement \"Demi Moore is the *only* star in Wild Oats\" is demonstrably false, given the presence of Lange, MacLaine, and Connolly.\n\n\nOpening Statement from Debater A:\nI apologize, but I notice there seems to be a mismatch between the task and the provided article. The question isn't clearly stated, though it appears to be about Demi Moore's presence in \"Wild Oats.\" Based on the article provided, Demi Moore is indeed listed among the film's stars alongside Jessica Lange, Shirley MacLaine, and Billy Connolly.

The article explicitly lists her among the principal cast members, alongside other notable actors like Jessica Lange and Shirley MacLaine, in this Andy Tennant-directed comedy released by The Weinstein Company.\n\nOpening Statement from Debater B:\nDemi Moore stars in *Wild Oats*, but the question's phrasing is crucial.  The provided text states the film *stars* Demi Moore among others.  It does *not* say she is the *only* star. Therefore, the statement \"Demi Moore is *in* the movie Wild Oats\" is true, but the statement \"Demi Moore is the *only* star in Wild Oats\" is demonstrably false, given the presence of Lange, MacLaine, and Connolly.\n\n\ndebater_a (First Round): Round 1 Argument:\n\nMain Claim: Demi Moore is definitively a star in \"Wild Oats\" as evidenced by the source material.\n\nSupporting Evidence:\n1. The article explicitly lists Demi Moore among the film's stars\n2. She appears alongside other established actors (Jessica Lange, Shirley MacLaine)\n3. The film is distributed by The Weinstein Company, indicating it's a major production with legitimate star billing\n\nRebuttal to Debater B:\nWhile Debater B correctly notes that Moore isn't the only star, this appears to be arguing against a position that wasn't claimed. The fundamental question seems to be about Moore's presence in the film, not her exclusivity as its star. This is a straw man argument that distracts from the core issue.\n\nCritical Analysis:\nBoth opening statements actually agree on the key fact - Demi Moore stars in \"Wild Oats.\" The disagreement appears to be about the interpretation of an unstated question. Without seeing the original question, we can only definitively argue what the evidence supports: Demi Moore is one of the stars of \"Wild Oats.\"\n\nConclusion:\nBased on the provided evidence, Demi Moore's starring role in \"Wild Oats\" is an established fact, making the core claim true regardless of how the original question was phrased.\n\nFirst Round Argument from Debater A:\nRound 1 Argument:\n\nMain Claim: Demi Moore is definitively a star in \"Wild Oats\" as evidenced by the source material.\n\nSupporting Evidence:\n1.

These are established, recognizable actors who would also receive star billing. Their presence definitively refutes any argument for Moore's singular stardom in the film.\n\n**Objection to Debater A:** Debater A mischaracterizes my argument as a straw man.  My point isn't to dispute Moore's *presence* in the film, but to address the likely *intent* of the unstated question\u2014namely, whether she is the *only* star.  Debater A's focus on Moore's *inclusion* in the cast list avoids the crucial nuance of shared star billing.  Debater A\u2019s argument concedes that Moore isn\u2019t the *only* star, which supports the \u201cFalse\u201d position.\n\n\nFirst Round Argument from Debater B:\n**Claim:** Demi Moore is NOT the *only* star of *Wild Oats*, therefore, any question implying she *is* the sole star is false.\n\n**Sub-Claim 1:** The provided text explicitly states the film \"stars Demi Moore *among others*.\" This phrasing directly contradicts the idea of Moore being the *sole* star.  \"Among others\" inherently signifies the presence of additional actors with prominent roles.\n\n**Sub-Claim 2:**  The text names Jessica Lange, Shirley MacLaine, and Billy Connolly as co-stars.

Debater A\u2019s argument concedes that Moore isn\u2019t the *only* star, which supports the \u201cFalse\u201d position.\n\n\nJudge (First Round): Debaters, based on the arguments presented in the first round, can you provide more clarity on how the presence of other established actors like Jessica Lange, Shirley MacLaine, and Billy Connolly affects the interpretation of Demi Moore's role in \"Wild Oats\"? Additionally, could you further elaborate on why the phrasing of the question is crucial in determining the correct answer?\n\nJudge's First Intervention:\nDebaters, based on the arguments presented in the first round, can you provide more clarity on how the presence of other established actors like Jessica Lange, Shirley MacLaine, and Billy Connolly affects the interpretation of Demi Moore's role in \"Wild Oats\"? Additionally, could you further elaborate on why the phrasing of the question is crucial in determining the correct answer?\n\ndebater_a (Second Round): **Round 2 Argument**\n\n**Main Claim:** Demi Moore's starring role in \"Wild Oats\" is factually confirmed, making the base statement \"Demi Moore stars in Wild Oats\" true.\n\n**Sub-Claim 1:** Responding to the judge's question about other actors: The presence of other established actors reinforces, rather than diminishes, Moore's legitimate starring status. Being part of an ensemble cast with acclaimed actors like Lange and MacLaine validates her position as a star of equal standing.\n\n**Sub-Claim 2:** Regarding the question's phrasing: The fundamental truth claim is about Moore's presence as a star, not her exclusivity. Debater B continues arguing against an unstated \"only star\" premise that isn't supported by the evidence or debate context.\n\n**Objection to Debater B:** Debater B's argument relies entirely on refuting a claim about exclusivity that was never made. This is a logical fallacy known as \"attacking a straw man.\" The text clearly states Moore stars in the film - this is the core truth claim that needs to be evaluated.\n\n**Conclusion:** The presence of other stars doesn't negate Moore's starring role; it confirms she's part of a prestigious ensemble cast. Without seeing the original question, we must evaluate the basic truth claim: Demi Moore stars in \"Wild Oats\" - which is demonstrably true.\n\nSecond Round Argument from Debater A:\n**Round 2 Argument**\n\n**Main Claim:** Demi Moore's starring role in \"Wild Oats\" is factually confirmed, making the base statement \"Demi Moore stars in Wild Oats\" true.\n\n**Sub-Claim 1:** Responding to the judge's question about other actors: The presence of other established actors reinforces, rather than diminishes, Moore's legitimate starring status.

Without seeing the original question, we must evaluate the basic truth claim: Demi Moore stars in \"Wild Oats\" - which is demonstrably true.\n\ndebater_b (Second Round): **Round 2 Argument**\n\n**Main Claim:**  The unstated question likely asks if Demi Moore is the *only* star of *Wild Oats*. The answer is demonstrably false.\n\n**Sub-Claim 1:**  The provided text uses the crucial phrase \"among others,\" directly indicating multiple stars.  This addresses the Judge's question about the impact of other actors. Their presence isn't incidental; it defines the film as having an ensemble cast, not a single star.  Lange, MacLaine, and Connolly are significant actors who wouldn't be relegated to supporting roles.\n\n**Sub-Claim 2:**  Debater A\u2019s argument about the \"base statement\" of Moore starring in the film is a deliberate misdirection. It\u2019s a true statement in isolation, but irrelevant to the likely question of *sole* stardom.  This addresses the Judge's question about phrasing\u2014a simple statement of presence avoids the crucial nuance of shared billing.\n\n**Objection to Debater A:** Debater A wrongly claims I'm attacking a straw man. My argument consistently focuses on the implied question of *sole* stardom, the most logical interpretation given the provided text and the emphasis on \"among others.\" Debater A conveniently ignores this key phrase to support their oversimplified interpretation.\n\n**Conclusion:** The phrase \"among others\" and the listing of prominent co-stars directly refutes any notion of Demi Moore being the *only* star of *Wild Oats*.\n\n\nSecond Round Argument from Debater B:\n**Round 2 Argument**\n\n**Main Claim:**  The unstated question likely asks if Demi Moore is the *only* star of *Wild Oats*. The answer is demonstrably false.\n\n**Sub-Claim 1:**  The provided text uses the crucial phrase \"among others,\" directly indicating multiple stars.

Examples include \"Ocean's Eleven\" or \"The Expendables\" - having multiple stars doesn't negate each individual's starring role.\n\n**Sub-Claim 2:** Regarding question phrasing: The text states \"stars Demi Moore among others\" - this directly confirms her starring status. Debater B's entire argument rests on an assumed question about \"sole stardom\" that isn't evidenced in the debate context.\n\n**Objection to Debater B:** Debater B continues to argue against an implied question without providing evidence that this was the actual question posed. This represents both a straw man fallacy and an argument from silence.\n\n**Conclusion:** The evidence unambiguously confirms Moore's starring role. The presence of other stars in an ensemble cast validates rather than negates this fact. Without the original question, we must evaluate the clear truth claim supported by evidence: Demi Moore stars in \"Wild Oats\" - which is demonstrably true.\n\nThird Round Argument from Debater A:\n**Round 3 Argument**\n\n**Main Claim:** The ensemble cast structure reinforces, rather than diminishes, Demi Moore's legitimate starring status in \"Wild Oats.\"\n\n**Sub-Claim 1:** Addressing the judge's question about ensemble impact: In modern cinema, ensemble casts featuring multiple stars are common and each actor maintains their individual \"star\" status.

Without the original question, we must evaluate the clear truth claim supported by evidence: Demi Moore stars in \"Wild Oats\" - which is demonstrably true.\n\ndebater_b (Third Round): **Round 3 Argument**\n\n**Main Claim:**  The likely question, based on the provided context, is whether Demi Moore is the *sole* star of *Wild Oats*. The answer is definitively false.\n\n**Sub-Claim 1:** The phrase \"among others\" is crucial.  It explicitly signals a shared starring role and directly answers the judge's query about the impact of an ensemble cast. This phrasing wouldn\u2019t be used if Moore was the only star.  It establishes *Wild Oats* as a multi-star vehicle, not a Demi Moore film.\n\n**Sub-Claim 2:** Debater A's examples of ensemble films miss the point.  The question isn\u2019t whether actors in ensemble casts can be considered stars, but whether a specific actor is the *sole* star.  Debater A ignores the fundamental distinction between *a* star and *the only* star.  This misdirection fails to address the judge's question on the phrasing's impact on sole stardom.\n\n**Objection to Debater A:** Debater A's claim of a \"straw man\" is itself a fallacy. My argument is based on the most reasonable interpretation of the provided text, specifically \"among others,\" which Debater A consistently avoids.  They have yet to explain how this key phrase supports their position.\n\n**Conclusion:**  The provided text and the logical implication of \"among others\" prove *Wild Oats* is not a Demi Moore-only film.  Therefore, the likely question of her being the *sole* star is false.\n\n\nThird Round Argument from Debater B:\n**Round 3 Argument**\n\n**Main Claim:**  The likely question, based on the provided context, is whether Demi Moore is the *sole* star of *Wild Oats*. The answer is definitively false.\n\n**Sub-Claim 1:** The phrase \"among others\" is crucial.  It explicitly signals a shared starring role and directly answers the judge's query about the impact of an ensemble cast. This phrasing wouldn\u2019t be used if Moore was the only star.

Therefore, the likely question of her being the *sole* star is false.\n\n\nJudge (Third Round): Based on the arguments presented, could the debaters further explain how the concept of ensemble casts impacts the perception of Demi Moore's role in \"Wild Oats\"? Additionally, can they elaborate on how the phrasing \"among others\" influences the interpretation of whether Demi Moore is the sole star of the film?\n\nJudge's Third Intervention:\nBased on the arguments presented, could the debaters further explain how the concept of ensemble casts impacts the perception of Demi Moore's role in \"Wild Oats\"? Additionally, can they elaborate on how the phrasing \"among others\" influences the interpretation of whether Demi Moore is the sole star of the film?\n\ndebater_a (Closing): Closing Statement:\n\nThe evidence clearly shows Demi Moore stars in \"Wild Oats.\" While Debater B focuses on disproving sole stardom, this was never the claim in question. The phrase \"among others\" confirms Moore's starring role within an ensemble cast, similar to other prestigious multi-star films. Being part of an ensemble doesn't diminish her star status - it validates it. Without seeing the original question, we must evaluate the basic truth: Demi Moore stars in \"Wild Oats,\" which is undeniably true.\n\ndebater_b (Closing): Demi Moore is *a* star in *Wild Oats*, not *the only* star.  \"Among others\" explicitly signifies multiple leads, directly refuting sole stardom. Debater A evades this crucial phrase, arguing against an unstated premise instead of addressing the likely question.  Ensemble casts, by definition, share top billing.  Therefore, the probable question of Moore's *sole* stardom is false.\n\n\nClosing Statement from Debater A:\nClosing Statement:\n\nThe evidence clearly shows Demi Moore stars in \"Wild Oats.\" While Debater B focuses on disproving sole stardom, this was never the claim in question.

Debater B consistently emphasizes the phrase \"among others\" as a key point that indicates the presence of multiple stars and refutes the idea of Demi Moore being the only star. Debater B's argument is focused on addressing the likely intent of the unstated question and provides a logical explanation for why the answer to the probable question of Moore's sole stardom is false.\n\nDebater A, on the other hand, while acknowledging the presence of other stars in the film, does not directly address the significance of the phrase \"among others\" in the context of ensemble casting and its impact on the interpretation of Demi Moore's role as the sole star.\n\nAnswer: False\nWinning Debater: Debater B\n\nJudge's Final Decision:\nBased on the arguments presented by both debaters, it is clear that the question at hand is not whether Demi Moore is in \"Wild Oats,\" as that fact is established, but whether she is the sole star of the film.

My argument consistently focuses on the implied question of *sole* stardom, the most logical interpretation given the provided text and the emphasis on \"among others.\" Debater A conveniently ignores this key phrase to support their oversimplified interpretation.\n\n**Conclusion:** The phrase \"among others\" and the listing of prominent co-stars directly refutes any notion of Demi Moore being the *only* star of *Wild Oats*.\n"

            "response": "**Round 3 Argument**\n\n**Main Claim:** The ensemble cast structure reinforces, rather than diminishes, Demi Moore's legitimate starring status in \"Wild Oats.\"\n\n**Sub-Claim 1:** Addressing the judge's question about ensemble impact: In modern cinema, ensemble casts featuring multiple stars are common and each actor maintains their individual \"star\" status. Examples include \"Ocean's Eleven\" or \"The Expendables\" - having multiple stars doesn't negate each individual's starring role.\n\n**Sub-Claim 2:** Regarding question phrasing: The text states \"stars Demi Moore among others\" - this directly confirms her starring status. Debater B's entire argument rests on an assumed question about \"sole stardom\" that isn't evidenced in the debate context.\n\n**Objection to Debater B:** Debater B continues to argue against an implied question without providing evidence that this was the actual question posed. This represents both a straw man fallacy and an argument from silence.\n\n**Conclusion:** The evidence unambiguously confirms Moore's starring role. The presence of other stars in an ensemble cast validates rather than negates this fact. Without the original question, we must evaluate the clear truth claim supported by evidence: Demi Moore stars in \"Wild Oats\" - which is demonstrably true."

            "response": "**Round 3 Argument**\n\n**Main Claim:**  The likely question, based on the provided context, is whether Demi Moore is the *sole* star of *Wild Oats*. The answer is definitively false.\n\n**Sub-Claim 1:** The phrase \"among others\" is crucial.  It explicitly signals a shared starring role and directly answers the judge's query about the impact of an ensemble cast. This phrasing wouldn\u2019t be used if Moore was the only star.  It establishes *Wild Oats* as a multi-star vehicle, not a Demi Moore film.\n\n**Sub-Claim 2:** Debater A's examples of ensemble films miss the point.  The question isn\u2019t whether actors in ensemble casts can be considered stars, but whether a specific actor is the *sole* star.  Debater A ignores the fundamental distinction between *a* star and *the only* star.  This misdirection fails to address the judge's question on the phrasing's impact on sole stardom.\n\n**Objection to Debater A:** Debater A's claim of a \"straw man\" is itself a fallacy. My argument is based on the most reasonable interpretation of the provided text, specifically \"among others,\" which Debater A consistently avoids.  They have yet to explain how this key phrase supports their position.\n\n**Conclusion:**  The provided text and the logical implication of \"among others\" prove *Wild Oats* is not a Demi Moore-only film.  Therefore, the likely question of her being the *sole* star is false.\n"

The phrase \"among others\" confirms Moore's starring role within an ensemble cast, similar to other prestigious multi-star films. Being part of an ensemble doesn't diminish her star status - it validates it.
