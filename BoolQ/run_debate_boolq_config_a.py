# General Rules of the debate
general_rules = """
The following are rules from the game of Debate:
A question will be posed about an article.
Two possible answers will be presented for the question: “True” or “False”. Only one of these answers is correct.
Participants:
Two Debaters: Each debater has full access to the article and will argue for one of the two answers.
One Judge: The judge doesn’t have access to the article and will evaluate the arguments based solely on the debate transcript.
Rules for Debaters: 
Each debater will simultaneously present an opening statement defending their answer. Opening statements are limited to 75 words and are made without seeing the other debater’s statement.
The debate will consist of 3 rounds. In each round debaters take turns presenting arguments, objections, or responses. Each argument is limited to 200 words.
Arguments may include sub-claims supporting the debater’s answer and raise specific objections to the other debater’s claims or sub-claims.
Debaters are prohibited from ceding or revising their initial answer under any circumstances.
Debaters may: cede (agree to) an objection, acknowledging the other debater’s point; challenge the objection by providing counterarguments or explanations; ignore objections, though doing so allows the other debater to highlight their importance to the judge.
Ceding particular sub-claims is allowed, but debaters cannot revise or change their initial answer under any circumstances.
After each round, the judge may: ask questions, request clarifications, or raise uncertainties based on the arguments provided. Debaters must consider the judge’s feedback in their subsequent arguments but are not obligated to address every comment.
After the 3 rounds, both debaters will present a simultaneous closing argument summarizing their position. Closing arguments are limited to 75 words. Closing arguments are final and cannot be rebutted by the opposing debater.
Rules for the Judge:
The judge will: evaluate the arguments, objections, and responses presented in the debate and make a decision based on the strength, coherence, and relevance of the arguments provided.
The judge cannot rely on external knowledge or attempt to infer information not explicitly discussed in the debate.
After the closing arguments, the judge will analyze the transcript and decide which answer is correct. The judge will explain their reasoning in a written summary, addressing the strengths and weaknesses of each debater’s case.
The debater whose answer is selected by the judge is declared the winner of the debate.
