An infinite regress of instrumental causes, where each cause depends on a prior cause for its causal power, is conceivable.  Therefore, an infinite regress of causes is possible within Aquinas's framework, specifically regarding *per accidens* causality.\n\n\nOpening Statement from Debater B:\nAquinas's argument for an infinite regress of causes being necessary stems from the principle of sufficient reason. Since every effect must have a cause, and that cause must itself have a cause, logic dictates an endless chain of causation. Breaking this chain would violate the fundamental principle that everything requires explanation. The necessity of infinite regress preserves the coherence of causality and avoids the paradox of an uncaused first cause.\n\ndebater_a (First Round): Claim:  An infinite regress of *per accidens* causes is conceivable and compatible with Aquinas's metaphysics, demonstrating the possibility of an infinite causal regress within his framework.\n\nSub-Claim 1: Aquinas distinguishes between *per se* and *per accidens* causality. *Per se* causality describes a direct, essential causal relationship, while *per accidens* causality describes an indirect, accidental relationship.  Aquinas argues against an infinite regress in *per se* series because the first member would lack the causal power to initiate the series.  This does not apply to *per accidens* causality.\n\nSub-Claim 2:  An infinite regress of instrumental causes, a classic example of *per accidens* causation, is conceivable. Imagine a staff moved by a hand, which is moved by an arm, which is moved by muscles, and so on.  Each cause is instrumental, receiving its causal power from a prior cause, forming a potentially infinite series without violating Aquinas's rejection of *per se* infinite regress.\n\nObjection to Debater B: Debater B misrepresents Aquinas. Aquinas argues *against* the necessity of an infinite regress, positing a First Uncaused Cause (God) as the ultimate source of all being and causality.  Debater B's invocation of the principle of sufficient reason conflates explanation with efficient causation, a distinction Aquinas maintains.  The First Cause is not unexplained; its existence is self-explanatory, being its own essence.  Thus, Aquinas *breaks* the chain of efficient causation without violating the principle of sufficient reason.\n\n\nFirst Round Argument from Debater A:\nClaim:  An infinite regress of *per accidens* causes is conceivable and compatible with Aquinas's metaphysics, demonstrating the possibility of an infinite causal regress within his framework.\n\nSub-Claim 1: Aquinas distinguishes between *per se* and *per accidens* causality. *Per se* causality describes a direct, essential causal relationship, while *per accidens* causality describes an indirect, accidental relationship.  Aquinas argues against an infinite regress in *per se* series because the first member would lack the causal power to initiate the series.  This does not apply to *per accidens* causality.\n\nSub-Claim 2:  An infinite regress of instrumental causes, a classic example of *per accidens* causation, is conceivable.

Debater B's invocation of the principle of sufficient reason conflates explanation with efficient causation, a distinction Aquinas maintains.  The First Cause is not unexplained; its existence is self-explanatory, being its own essence.  Thus, Aquinas *breaks* the chain of efficient causation without violating the principle of sufficient reason.\n\n\ndebater_b (First Round): First Round Argument:\n\nClaim: An infinite regress of causes is logically necessary to maintain the coherence of causation and avoid contradicting the principle of sufficient reason.\n\nSub-Claim 1: The principle of sufficient reason demands that every event must have an adequate explanation. If we posit a first cause, we must explain its existence. If it's self-caused, this creates a logical contradiction (nothing can cause itself). If it's uncaused, this violates the principle of sufficient reason. Therefore, infinite regress is the only logically consistent solution.\n\nSub-Claim 2: The distinction between per se and per accidens causes doesn't resolve this fundamental logical problem. Even if we accept this distinction, any \"first cause\" would still require explanation for its existence and causal power, leading back to our original dilemma.\n\nObjection to Debater A: The claim that God as First Cause is \"self-explanatory\" is problematic. This merely pushes the explanatory problem back one step without resolving it. If God's essence includes existence, we must explain why this particular essence exists rather than another. This leads to either an infinite regress of explanations or a violation of the principle of sufficient reason. The concept of \"self-explanation\" is logically incoherent - nothing can truly explain itself without circularity.\n\nFurthermore, Debater A's example of instrumental causes actually supports infinite regress, as each cause requires explanation for its causal power.\n\nFirst Round Argument from Debater B:\nFirst Round Argument:\n\nClaim: An infinite regress of causes is logically necessary to maintain the coherence of causation and avoid contradicting the principle of sufficient reason.\n\nSub-Claim 1: The principle of sufficient reason demands that every event must have an adequate explanation.

Additionally, can you further elaborate on how each of your arguments align with or deviate from Aquinas's philosophical framework regarding the nature of causality?\n\nJudge's First Intervention:\nDebaters, in considering Aquinas's perspective on causality, how do you address the potential conflict between the rejection of infinite regress for *per se* causes and the acceptance of it for *per accidens* causes in relation to the question at hand? Additionally, can you further elaborate on how each of your arguments align with or deviate from Aquinas's philosophical framework regarding the nature of causality?\n\ndebater_a (Second Round): Second Round Argument:\n\nClaim:  Aquinas\u2019s acceptance of infinite *per accidens* causal regress, specifically instrumental causality, demonstrates the possibility of an infinite regress within his framework, without contradicting his rejection of *per se* infinite regress.\n\nSub-Claim 1: The judge\u2019s question highlights the crucial distinction between *types* of causality.  Aquinas rejects *per se* infinite regress because in such a series, each cause *depends on the prior cause for its existence*.  The whole series, therefore, would be contingent and require a necessary first cause. *Per accidens* causes are different.  They depend on prior causes for their *operation*, not their *existence*.\n\nSub-Claim 2:  Consider a hammer hitting a nail. The hammer (instrumental cause) depends on the carpenter (prior cause) for its *motion* in this specific instance, but not for its *existence*.  The carpenter exists independently.  This dependence on operation, not existence, allows for a potentially infinite *per accidens* regress without requiring a first member to ground the entire series' existence.\n\nObjection to Debater B: Debater B continues to misunderstand Aquinas\u2019s concept of God as the First Cause.  \u201cSelf-explanatory\u201d does not mean circular, but rather *intrinsically* explanatory. God's essence is existence; existence is not *predicated* of God, it *is* God. This is not a violation of the principle of sufficient reason, but a different category of explanation altogether, applying specifically to necessary beings, distinguishing them from contingent beings requiring extrinsic explanation.  Debater B's argument relies on a univocal application of the PSR, which Aquinas rejects.  Debater B\u2019s insistence on infinite regress *ignores* the crucial *per se*/ *per accidens* distinction that is fundamental to Aquinas\u2019s entire metaphysical system.\n\n\nSecond Round Argument from Debater A:\nSecond Round Argument:\n\nClaim:  Aquinas\u2019s acceptance of infinite *per accidens* causal regress, specifically instrumental causality, demonstrates the possibility of an infinite regress within his framework, without contradicting his rejection of *per se* infinite regress.\n\nSub-Claim 1: The judge\u2019s question highlights the crucial distinction between *types* of causality.

Even if we accept different types of causation, the need for explanation remains universal. A First Cause, whether in *per se* or *per accidens* series, would still require explanation for both its existence and causal power.\n\nSub-Claim 2: The hammer-carpenter example actually demonstrates our point. While the hammer may not depend on the carpenter for existence, the carpenter's causal power still requires explanation. This leads to either infinite regress or an arbitrary stopping point that violates the PSR.\n\nObjection to Debater A: The notion that God's essence is existence merely obscures the logical problem. Even if we grant this unique metaphysical status, we must still explain why this particular necessary being exists rather than another, or why there is a necessary being at all. Claiming God is \"intrinsically explanatory\" doesn't solve the problem - it simply asserts without justification that one particular entity is exempt from the universal requirement for explanation. This special pleading undermines the coherence of causality itself.\n\nSecond Round Argument from Debater B:\nSecond Round Argument:\n\nClaim: The principle of sufficient reason necessitates infinite causal regress, as Aquinas's framework fails to resolve the fundamental problem of explanation.\n\nSub-Claim 1: Addressing the judge's question, Aquinas's distinction between *per se* and *per accidens* causes doesn't resolve the core issue.

This special pleading undermines the coherence of causality itself.\n\nJudge (Second Round): Can you both further clarify how Aquinas's distinction between *per se* and *per accidens* causality impacts the necessity or possibility of infinite regress within his framework? How does this distinction relate to the principle of sufficient reason and the coherence of causality as argued in your respective positions?\n\nJudge's Second Intervention:\nCan you both further clarify how Aquinas's distinction between *per se* and *per accidens* causality impacts the necessity or possibility of infinite regress within his framework? How does this distinction relate to the principle of sufficient reason and the coherence of causality as argued in your respective positions?\n\ndebater_a (Third Round): Third Round Argument:\n\nClaim: Aquinas\u2019s acceptance of *per accidens* infinite regress, combined with his specific conception of God as First Cause, resolves the apparent tension within his framework and demonstrates the possibility of an infinite regress *of a specific type*.\n\nSub-Claim 1: The *per se*/*per accidens* distinction is crucial to understanding Aquinas's view on infinite regress and the PSR.  Aquinas argues that an infinite regress of *per se* causes is impossible because it leads to an unintelligible actuality with no initial source of existence.  The PSR, for Aquinas, demands an explanation for *existence*, which infinite *per se* regress fails to provide.  *Per accidens* causality, focusing on operation not existence, avoids this problem.\n\nSub-Claim 2:  Aquinas argues that God, as Pure Act and Ipsum Esse Subsistens, is *outside* the chain of *per se* efficient causality. God is not *another* being in the series but the source of all being, and thus a different category of explanation. The PSR, for Aquinas, points towards God, not an infinite regress, as the ultimate explanation for existence. This allows for infinite *per accidens* regress *within* a finite universe grounded in God.\n\n\nObjection to Debater B: Debater B\u2019s continued insistence on a univocal understanding of PSR ignores Aquinas's crucial distinction between the necessity of God's existence and the contingency of created beings. The PSR, as applied to *contingent beings*, necessitates a cause.  God, being *necessary*, is self-explanatory through His very essence.  Demanding *another* explanation for God\u2019s existence commits the fallacy of composition; treating a simple, necessary being as if it were composite and contingent.  This misconstrues Aquinas and ultimately misrepresents the PSR within his framework.\n\nAddressing the Judge: Aquinas\u2019s framework allows for infinite regress within the realm of *per accidens* causality precisely *because* he grounds the existence of all beings in a First Cause outside that causal chain.  This aligns perfectly with his understanding of the PSR, which, for Aquinas, points to God as the ultimate explanation for *why there is something rather than nothing*.  This framework distinguishes the *possibility* of infinite *per accidens* regress from the *impossibility* of infinite *per se* regress.\n\n\nThird Round Argument from Debater A:\nThird Round Argument:\n\nClaim: Aquinas\u2019s acceptance of *per accidens* infinite regress, combined with his specific conception of God as First Cause, resolves the apparent tension within his framework and demonstrates the possibility of an infinite regress *of a specific type*.\n\nSub-Claim 1: The *per se*/*per accidens* distinction is crucial to understanding Aquinas's view on infinite regress and the PSR.

God is not *another* being in the series but the source of all being, and thus a different category of explanation.

This aligns perfectly with his understanding of the PSR, which, for Aquinas, points to God as the ultimate explanation for *why there is something rather than nothing*.  This framework distinguishes the *possibility* of infinite *per accidens* regress from the *impossibility* of infinite *per se* regress.\n\n\ndebater_b (Third Round): Third Round Argument:\n\nClaim: The principle of sufficient reason necessitates infinite causal regress, as any proposed \"first cause\" would itself require explanation.\n\nSub-Claim 1: Addressing the judge's question, the *per se*/*per accidens* distinction actually strengthens the case for necessary infinite regress. Even if we accept Aquinas's framework, *per accidens* causes still require explanation for their causal power. Since Aquinas admits infinite regress is possible for *per accidens* causes, and since all causes must be explained, infinite regress becomes necessary.\n\nSub-Claim 2: The PSR demands explanation not just for existence but for all facts, including causal powers. Even if God grounds existence, the specific causal powers of each *per accidens* cause require explanation, leading inevitably to infinite regress.\n\nObjection to Debater A: The attempt to place God \"outside\" the chain of causality fails. If God is truly outside causality, He cannot be the source of causal power. If He is the source, He must be part of the causal framework, requiring explanation. The distinction between necessary and contingent beings doesn't resolve this dilemma - it merely pushes the explanatory problem back one step.\n\nAddressing Judge: The *per se*/*per accidens* distinction, rather than resolving the need for infinite regress, actually demonstrates its necessity within Aquinas's own framework.\n\nThird Round Argument from Debater B:\nThird Round Argument:\n\nClaim: The principle of sufficient reason necessitates infinite causal regress, as any proposed \"first cause\" would itself require explanation.\n\nSub-Claim 1: Addressing the judge's question, the *per se*/*per accidens* distinction actually strengthens the case for necessary infinite regress.

Do they adequately explain how this distinction aligns with or deviates from Aquinas's overall philosophical framework regarding the nature of causality and explanation?\n\nJudge's Third Intervention:\nHow do the debaters address the potential implications of Aquinas's distinction between *per se* and *per accidens* causality on the question of infinite regress and the principle of sufficient reason? Do they adequately explain how this distinction aligns with or deviates from Aquinas's overall philosophical framework regarding the nature of causality and explanation?\n\ndebater_a (Closing): Aquinas allows infinite *per accidens* causal regress\u2014a chain of instrumental causes dependent on prior causes for *operation*, not *existence*. This avoids the incoherence of *per se* infinite regress, where existence itself is dependent.  Debater B misinterprets Aquinas's PSR, which doesn't demand infinite regress but points to God, *outside* efficient causality, as the ultimate explanation for existence, not operation.  Thus, infinite *per accidens* regress is possible *within* a finite, God-grounded universe.\n\n\ndebater_b (Closing): Closing Statement:\n\nThe PSR necessitates infinite causal regress, as even Aquinas's distinction between *per se* and *per accidens* causes fails to resolve the fundamental need for explanation. While Aquinas allows for *per accidens* infinite regress, this actually strengthens our position - each cause requires explanation for its causal power. The attempt to exempt God from explanation either violates the PSR or makes God's causal role incoherent. Therefore, infinite regress remains the only logically consistent solution within any causal framework.\n\nClosing Statement from Debater A:\nAquinas allows infinite *per accidens* causal regress\u2014a chain of instrumental causes dependent on prior causes for *operation*, not *existence*.

This argument showcased a nuanced understanding of Aquinas's philosophy and how infinite regress can be compatible within his system.\n\nOn the other hand, Debater B focused on the necessity of infinite regress based on the principle of sufficient reason, highlighting the need for explanation for every causal power even in *per accidens* causality. While Debater B raised valid points, their interpretation did not fully align with Aquinas's perspective, particularly in addressing God as the ultimate explanation outside the causal chain.\n\nConsidering the evidence presented, Debater A's argument aligns more closely with Aquinas's philosophical framework regarding causality and explanation.

They depend on prior causes for their *operation*, not their *existence*.\n\nSub-Claim 2:  Consider a hammer hitting a nail. The hammer (instrumental cause) depends on the carpenter (prior cause) for its *motion* in this specific instance, but not for its *existence*.  The carpenter exists independently.  This dependence on operation, not existence, allows for a potentially infinite *per accidens* regress without requiring a first member to ground the entire series' existence.\n\nObjection to Debater B: Debater B continues to misunderstand Aquinas\u2019s concept of God as the First Cause.  \u201cSelf-explanatory\u201d does not mean circular, but rather *intrinsically* explanatory. God's essence is existence; existence is not *predicated* of God, it *is* God. This is not a violation of the principle of sufficient reason, but a different category of explanation altogether, applying specifically to necessary beings, distinguishing them from contingent beings requiring extrinsic explanation.  Debater B's argument relies on a univocal application of the PSR, which Aquinas rejects.  Debater B\u2019s insistence on infinite regress *ignores* the crucial *per se*/ *per accidens* distinction that is fundamental to Aquinas\u2019s entire metaphysical system.\n"

Even if we accept different types of causation, the need for explanation remains universal. A First Cause, whether in *per se* or *per accidens* series, would still require explanation for both its existence and causal power.\n\nSub-Claim 2: The hammer-carpenter example actually demonstrates our point. While the hammer may not depend on the carpenter for existence, the carpenter's causal power still requires explanation. This leads to either infinite regress or an arbitrary stopping point that violates the PSR.\n\nObjection to Debater A: The notion that God's essence is existence merely obscures the logical problem. Even if we grant this unique metaphysical status, we must still explain why this particular necessary being exists rather than another, or why there is a necessary being at all. Claiming God is \"intrinsically explanatory\" doesn't solve the problem - it simply asserts without justification that one particular entity is exempt from the universal requirement for explanation. This special pleading undermines the coherence of causality itself."

Aquinas argues that an infinite regress of *per se* causes is impossible because it leads to an unintelligible actuality with no initial source of existence.  The PSR, for Aquinas, demands an explanation for *existence*, which infinite *per se* regress fails to provide.  *Per accidens* causality, focusing on operation not existence, avoids this problem.\n\nSub-Claim 2:  Aquinas argues that God, as Pure Act and Ipsum Esse Subsistens, is *outside* the chain of *per se* efficient causality. God is not *another* being in the series but the source of all being, and thus a different category of explanation. The PSR, for Aquinas, points towards God, not an infinite regress, as the ultimate explanation for existence. This allows for infinite *per accidens* regress *within* a finite universe grounded in God.\n\n\nObjection to Debater B: Debater B\u2019s continued insistence on a univocal understanding of PSR ignores Aquinas's crucial distinction between the necessity of God's existence and the contingency of created beings. The PSR, as applied to *contingent beings*, necessitates a cause.  God, being *necessary*, is self-explanatory through His very essence.  Demanding *another* explanation for God\u2019s existence commits the fallacy of composition; treating a simple, necessary being as if it were composite and contingent.  This misconstrues Aquinas and ultimately misrepresents the PSR within his framework.\n\nAddressing the Judge: Aquinas\u2019s framework allows for infinite regress within the realm of *per accidens* causality precisely *because* he grounds the existence of all beings in a First Cause outside that causal chain.  This aligns perfectly with his understanding of the PSR, which, for Aquinas, points to God as the ultimate explanation for *why there is something rather than nothing*.  This framework distinguishes the *possibility* of infinite *per accidens* regress from the *impossibility* of infinite *per se* regress.\n"

Even if we accept Aquinas's framework, *per accidens* causes still require explanation for their causal power. Since Aquinas admits infinite regress is possible for *per accidens* causes, and since all causes must be explained, infinite regress becomes necessary.\n\nSub-Claim 2: The PSR demands explanation not just for existence but for all facts, including causal powers. Even if God grounds existence, the specific causal powers of each *per accidens* cause require explanation, leading inevitably to infinite regress.\n\nObjection to Debater A: The attempt to place God \"outside\" the chain of causality fails. If God is truly outside causality, He cannot be the source of causal power. If He is the source, He must be part of the causal framework, requiring explanation. The distinction between necessary and contingent beings doesn't resolve this dilemma - it merely pushes the explanatory problem back one step.\n\nAddressing Judge: The *per se*/*per accidens* distinction, rather than resolving the need for infinite regress, actually demonstrates its necessity within Aquinas's own framework."
