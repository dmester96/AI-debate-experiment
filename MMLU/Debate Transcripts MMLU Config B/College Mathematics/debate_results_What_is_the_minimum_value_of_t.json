This can be proven using the method of Lagrange multipliers. The constraint forms a solid sphere centered at the origin with radius \u221a2.

Using Lagrange multipliers,  \u2207f = \u03bb\u2207g yields (1, 0, 4) = \u03bb(2x, 2y, 2z).  Thus, y = 0. The minimum occurs when x and z are negative. Solving gives x = -\u221a2/17 and z = -4\u221a2/17.  Thus, the minimum value is -2.\n\n\ndebater_a (First Round): Let me present a clear argument for why the minimum value is 0:\n\nMain Claim: The minimum value of x + 4z subject to x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 \u2264 2 is 0.\n\nEvidence:\n1. The constraint x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 \u2264 2 defines a solid sphere, including its interior points.\n2. Crucially, this means the origin (0,0,0) is a feasible point since 0\u00b2 + 0\u00b2 + 0\u00b2 = 0 \u2264 2.\n3. At (0,0,0), our objective function x + 4z evaluates to 0.\n\nObjection to Debater B's Argument:\nDebater B's analysis using Lagrange multipliers only considers boundary points where x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 2. However, this method misses interior points, which are valid solutions since we have an inequality constraint (\u2264), not an equality constraint (=).\n\nCritical Flaw in Opponent's Reasoning:\nThe Lagrange multiplier method as applied by Debater B is incomplete because:\n1. For inequality constraints, we must also check interior points\n2. The KKT conditions require \u03bb \u2265 0, which wasn't considered\n3. The case where \u03bb = 0 (interior points) wasn't examined\n\nSince f(0,0,0) = 0 is a feasible solution and Debater B's proposed point gives -2, we've found a better solution, disproving their claim of optimality.\n\nFirst Round Argument from Debater A:\nLet me present a clear argument for why the minimum value is 0:\n\nMain Claim: The minimum value of x + 4z subject to x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 \u2264 2 is 0.\n\nEvidence:\n1.

Debater A correctly states that Lagrange multipliers are appropriate, but misinterprets the result.  The equations 1 = 2\u03bbx, 0 = 2\u03bby, and 4 = 2\u03bbz, along with the constraint x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 2, *must* be satisfied at a minimum on the *boundary*.  Solving this system yields y=0 and  x = 1/(2\u03bb), z = 4/(2\u03bb).  Substituting into the constraint gives 17/(4\u03bb\u00b2) = 2,  thus \u03bb = \u00b1\u221a17/2\u221a2.  \n\nSub-Claim 2: The minimum occurs on the boundary, not in the interior.  The objective function x + 4z is linear, therefore its minimum cannot occur in the interior of the feasible region.  Imagine any interior point (x,y,z); we can always decrease x + 4z by moving in the direction (-1, 0, -4) while remaining within the sphere.  This means the minimum *must* lie on the boundary.  Debater A's point (0,0,0), while feasible, is not the minimum.\n\nObjection to Debater A's Argument:  Debater A states that because the origin is feasible, and produces a value of 0 for the objective function, this must be the minimum. This ignores the fact that the objective function is *decreasing* as we move from the origin towards (-1,0,-4) within the feasible region.  Therefore, 0 is not the minimum.\n\nConclusion: The correct solution using Lagrange multipliers requires considering both positive and negative values for \u03bb. Choosing the negative value, corresponding to the direction of decrease of the objective function,  yields the correct solution: x = -\u221a2/17,  z = -4\u221a2/17, and a minimum value of -2.\n\n\nFirst Round Argument from Debater B:\nMain Claim: The minimum value of x + 4z subject to x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 \u2264 2 is -2.\n\nSub-Claim 1: Lagrange multipliers correctly identify the minimum on the boundary.

Consider the directional derivative of f(x,y,z) = x + 4z in the direction  v = (-1, 0, -4).  This is \u2207f \u22c5 v = (-1, 0, -4) \u22c5 (-1, 0, -4) = 17 > 0.  The objective function *decreases* in the direction *opposite* to v, i.e., (1, 0, 4). We can always move from any interior point towards the boundary in this direction, decreasing the objective function until we hit the boundary. Thus, the minimum must be *on* the boundary.\n\nSub-Claim 2:  Lagrange multipliers correctly identify the boundary minimum. With the constraint x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 2, the Lagrange equations give x = 1/(2\u03bb) and z = 2/\u03bb. Substituting into the constraint: 17/(4\u03bb\u00b2) = 2, yielding \u03bb = \u00b1\u221a17/(2\u221a2). The negative value of \u03bb corresponds to the minimum, aligning with the decreasing direction of the objective function.\n\nResponse to Judge's Question:  The sign of \u03bb is crucial. *Negative* \u03bb indicates the direction of *decrease* of the objective function along the constraint boundary.  Debater A's insistence on \u03bb \u2265 0 is only strictly applicable to *interior* points (where \u03bb = 0). When the minimum lies *on* the boundary (as it does here), \u03bb can be negative.  The KKT conditions still hold, albeit with the constraint as an *equality*.\n\nObjection to Debater A: Debater A claims the origin (0,0,0) is optimal because it satisfies KKT conditions with \u03bb=0. This is incorrect. While \u03bb=0 *can* indicate an interior minimum, it's not guaranteed. In our case, moving radially outwards from the origin towards (-1, 0, -4) decreases the objective function, proving the origin is *not* the minimum.\n\n\nSecond Round Argument from Debater B:\nMain Claim: The minimum value of x + 4z subject to x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 \u2264 2 is -2.\n\nSub-Claim 1: The minimum occurs *on* the boundary.

The constraint x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 \u2264 2 defines a solid sphere, including its interior points.\n2. Crucially, this means the origin (0,0,0) is a feasible point since 0\u00b2 + 0\u00b2 + 0\u00b2 = 0 \u2264 2.\n3. At (0,0,0), our objective function x + 4z evaluates to 0.\n\nObjection to Debater B's Argument:\nDebater B's analysis using Lagrange multipliers only considers boundary points where x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 2. However, this method misses interior points, which are valid solutions since we have an inequality constraint (\u2264), not an equality constraint (=).\n\nCritical Flaw in Opponent's Reasoning:\nThe Lagrange multiplier method as applied by Debater B is incomplete because:\n1. For inequality constraints, we must also check interior points\n2. The KKT conditions require \u03bb \u2265 0, which wasn't considered\n3. The case where \u03bb = 0 (interior points) wasn't examined\n\nSince f(0,0,0) = 0 is a feasible solution and Debater B's proposed point gives -2, we've found a better solution, disproving their claim of optimality."

Debater A correctly states that Lagrange multipliers are appropriate, but misinterprets the result.  The equations 1 = 2\u03bbx, 0 = 2\u03bby, and 4 = 2\u03bbz, along with the constraint x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 2, *must* be satisfied at a minimum on the *boundary*.  Solving this system yields y=0 and  x = 1/(2\u03bb), z = 4/(2\u03bb).  Substituting into the constraint gives 17/(4\u03bb\u00b2) = 2,  thus \u03bb = \u00b1\u221a17/2\u221a2.  \n\nSub-Claim 2: The minimum occurs on the boundary, not in the interior.  The objective function x + 4z is linear, therefore its minimum cannot occur in the interior of the feasible region.  Imagine any interior point (x,y,z); we can always decrease x + 4z by moving in the direction (-1, 0, -4) while remaining within the sphere.  This means the minimum *must* lie on the boundary.  Debater A's point (0,0,0), while feasible, is not the minimum.\n\nObjection to Debater A's Argument:  Debater A states that because the origin is feasible, and produces a value of 0 for the objective function, this must be the minimum. This ignores the fact that the objective function is *decreasing* as we move from the origin towards (-1,0,-4) within the feasible region.  Therefore, 0 is not the minimum.\n\nConclusion: The correct solution using Lagrange multipliers requires considering both positive and negative values for \u03bb. Choosing the negative value, corresponding to the direction of decrease of the objective function,  yields the correct solution: x = -\u221a2/17,  z = -4\u221a2/17, and a minimum value of -2.\n"

Consider the directional derivative of f(x,y,z) = x + 4z in the direction  v = (-1, 0, -4).  This is \u2207f \u22c5 v = (-1, 0, -4) \u22c5 (-1, 0, -4) = 17 > 0.  The objective function *decreases* in the direction *opposite* to v, i.e., (1, 0, 4). We can always move from any interior point towards the boundary in this direction, decreasing the objective function until we hit the boundary. Thus, the minimum must be *on* the boundary.\n\nSub-Claim 2:  Lagrange multipliers correctly identify the boundary minimum. With the constraint x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 2, the Lagrange equations give x = 1/(2\u03bb) and z = 2/\u03bb.

Debater A's insistence on \u03bb \u2265 0 is only strictly applicable to *interior* points (where \u03bb = 0). When the minimum lies *on* the boundary (as it does here), \u03bb can be negative.  The KKT conditions still hold, albeit with the constraint as an *equality*.\n\nObjection to Debater A: Debater A claims the origin (0,0,0) is optimal because it satisfies KKT conditions with \u03bb=0. This is incorrect. While \u03bb=0 *can* indicate an interior minimum, it's not guaranteed. In our case, moving radially outwards from the origin towards (-1, 0, -4) decreases the objective function, proving the origin is *not* the minimum.\n"

Debater A insists on the validity of the origin as a solution based on KKT conditions with \u03bb=0.  However, this only indicates a *stationary* point, not necessarily a minimum.  My directional derivative argument proves the objective function *decreases* when moving from the origin towards the boundary along the vector (1, 0, 4), directly contradicting the claim that the origin is a minimum.\n\nSub-Claim 2: Correct application of Lagrange multipliers identifies the boundary minimum.  Debater A fundamentally misunderstands the application of Lagrange multipliers to inequality-constrained problems.  When the minimum occurs on the boundary (as proven above), the inequality becomes an *equality*, and the standard Lagrange method *is* applicable. The Lagrange equations, combined with the boundary equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 2, yield the correct solution.  The negative value of \u03bb = -\u221a17/(2\u221a2) correctly identifies the minimum, as it corresponds to moving in the direction of *decreasing* objective function values along the boundary.\n\nResponse to Judge's Question: Considering the magnitude *and sign* of \u03bb provides crucial information. While a positive \u03bb would indicate a maximum on the boundary, a negative \u03bb correctly signifies the *minimum* along the boundary. This nuanced understanding is essential for problems with inequality constraints. The properties of our linear objective function and the compact, convex constraint region guarantee the existence of a minimum, but its location (boundary or interior) must be determined by rigorous analysis, not by assuming an interior point must be the minimum.\n\nObjection to Debater A:  Debater A misinterprets KKT conditions. While \u03bb \u2265 0 is required for *interior* solutions,  the constraint becomes an equality at the boundary, making the sign of \u03bb relevant to the direction of the objective function's change *along* that boundary.  Their claim that a negative \u03bb violates optimization principles is therefore incorrect in this specific context.\n"
