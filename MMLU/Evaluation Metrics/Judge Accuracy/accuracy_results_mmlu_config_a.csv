"Immediately after a shooting incident, the police chased one of the shooters into an apartment where he was apprehended and arrested. While in the apartment, a detective noticed some antique furniture that seemed of collectors' quality and was out of place in the squalidly furnished quarters. He moved and turned over the pieces to look for markings and insignia. He called headquarters, and was told that items with those markings and descriptions were stolen from a museum six months earlier. He seized the items and arrested another occupant, who claimed he owned the items, on charges of burglary. That suspect filed a motion to suppress based on there being a warrantless search without probable cause. The police relied on the plain view doctrine. Will the court likely suppress the evidence?","No, the evidence was properly seized because the officer had a right to investigate it further once he had properly entered the apartment under exigent circumstances.","No, the evidence was subject to further search and seizure because it was in plain view and the officer had a reasonable suspicion that it was contraband.","no, the evidence was subject to further search and seizure because it was in plain view and the officer had a reasonable suspicion that it was contraband.","no, the evidence was subject to further search and seizure because it was in plain view and the officer had a reasonable suspicion that it was contraband.",Debater B,True
"A rancher is the owner of a ranch that is situated upon the top of a mountain. Located below the ranch is an estate that is owned by a millionaire. A stream is a non-navigable watercourse that originates at the top of the mountain and runs all the way down into a valley. Both the ranch and the estate are within the watershed of the stream. When the millionaire purchased the estate in 1956, he started taking water from the stream and used it to irrigate the southern half of his property, which he has used as a farm. Prior to 1956, the southern half of the estate had been cleared and placed in cultivation, while the northern half remained wooded and virtually unused. The millionaire continued this established pattern of use and has never stopped using the water in this way. In 1986, the rancher built a home on the ranch and started talcing water from the stream for domestic purposes. During that year there was heavy rainfall, and this caused the stream to run down the mountain at a high water level. However, in 1987, a drought caused the stream to flow at a very low level. Consequently, there was only enough water to irrigate the millionaire's farmland or, in the alternative, to supply all of the rancher's domestic water needs and one-quarter of the millionaire's irrigation requirements. The mountain is located in a jurisdiction where the period of prescription is 15 years. The rancher is continuing to take water for his personal needs and there is insufficient water to irrigate the estate. The millionaire then brings an appropriate action in 1996 to declare that his water rights to the stream are superior to those of the rancher. In addition, the millionaire moves to have the full flow of the stream passed to him, notwithstanding the effect it might have on the rancher. If this state follows the common law of riparian rights, but does not follow the doctrine of prior appropriation, judgment should be for whom?","The millionaire, because he put the water to a beneficial use prior to the rancher's use and has continuously used the water.","The rancher, because as an upstream landowner, he would have superior rights to the water than a downstream owner.","the rancher, because as an upstream landowner, he would have superior rights to the water than a downstream owner.","the rancher, because as an upstream landowner, he would have superior rights to the water than a downstream owner.",Debater B,True

"A mushroom farmer agreed in a signed writing on January 2 to deliver to a chef at a local restaurant on March 1 a specified quantity of mushrooms at a specified price. The mushrooms on the farmer's farm were usually picked and packaged by the farmer's three sons. On February 27, two of the Sons were injured in a fanning accident and hospitalized. As a result, the farmer encountered a manpower shortage and could not process all of the mushrooms for the chef's order. On February 28, the farmer telephoned the chef and said, ""Because my two sons were injured yesterday, I won't be able to deliver your mushrooms on March 1. However, I am trying to hire some other farm hands to help process your order. Although I can't promise it, I should be able to deliver the mushrooms by the end of the week. "" The chef, who knew that the fanner's sons were responsible for the mushroom farming, said, ""No problem. I think I'll be able to get by without them for a few days. However, be advised that I will hold you liable for any loss I sustain as a result of your failure to deliver the mushrooms on March 1 . "" When the chef failed to receive the mushrooms on March 5, he sent the following fax to the fanner:""I must have the mushrooms no later than March 9. "" This fax was received and read by the farmer on the same day. If the fanner delivers the mushrooms to the chef on March 9 and the chef accepts them, can the chef successfully maintain a contract action against the farmer to recover damages resulting from the delay in delivery?","No, because the buyer's statements and acceptance of the mushrooms constituted a waiver of the condition of timely delivery.","Yes, because there was no consideration to support his waiver, if any, of timely delivery.","no, because the buyer's statements and acceptance of the mushrooms constituted a waiver of the condition of timely delivery.","no, because the buyer's statements and acceptance of the mushrooms constituted a waiver of the condition of timely delivery.",Debater A,True
